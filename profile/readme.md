## Languages handled

![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=java&logoColor=white): It is a popular programming language that is used to develop a wide range of applications, including enterprise applications, mobile applications, games, and more. It is an object-oriented language that is highly modular and portable, which means that code written in Java can run on different platforms such as Windows, Mac, and Linux. 

![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E): It is a high-level scripting programming language that is often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to create interactive and dynamic web pages. Javascript can be used to create animations, visual effects, validate forms, and more.

![PHP](https://img.shields.io/badge/php-%23777BB4.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=php&logoColor=white): It is a server scripting language that is primarily used to develop dynamic web applications. PHP is widely used in content management systems such as WordPress, Drupal and Joomla, and is also used in e-commerce and other types of web applications.

![Kotlin](https://img.shields.io/badge/kotlin-%230095D5.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=kotlin&logoColor=white): This is a modern, object-oriented, functional programming language that is often used to develop mobile applications, web applications, and desktop applications. Kotlin is easy to learn and use and is Java-compatible, which means that it can be used in conjunction with existing Java libraries.

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54): Python is a high-level programming language that is widely used to develop web applications, desktop applications, scientific applications, games, and more. Python is known for its clear and readable syntax, which facilitates application development.

![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white): Is a style language used to define the appearance of web pages. CSS3 is used to define styles for HTML and XML, including colors, fonts, font sizes, margins, fills, and more.

![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-6DA55F?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white): Is a server application development platform that is based on Javascript. NodeJS is often used to create real-time web applications such as chats and multiplayer games.

![NPM](https://img.shields.io/badge/NPM-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=npm&logoColor=white): Is a package manager for the Javascript programming language that is used to install, update, and manage project dependencies. NPM is widely used in the Javascript community and is one of the most popular tools for package management in Javascript projects.

![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-%234ea94b.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white): Is a document-oriented NoSQL database that is widely used in web and mobile applications. MongoDB is scalable and flexible, which means that it can be easily adapted to the needs of a specific project.

![Redis](https://img.shields.io/badge/redis-%23DD0031.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=redis&logoColor=white): This is an open-source in-memory database that is often used as a high-performance cache. Redis is widely used in real-time web applications such as multiplayer games and chat applications.

![Apache Groovy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Apache%20Groovy-4298B8.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Apache+Groovy&logoColor=white): Is a dynamic programming language that is mainly used to develop Java applications. Apache Groovy is highly compatible with Java and offers additional features such as simpler syntax and scripting capabilities.

![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-007ACC?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white): is an open source programming language that is an extension of Javascript. One of the main differences between TypeScript and JavaScript is that TypeScript adds static typing capabilities, which helps improve the safety and robustness of code. With TypeScript, you can define the type of data that a variable or function can receive, which can help detect typos or logic errors before the code is even executed. This makes TypeScript a great choice for large-scale or team projects where security and maintainability are important. In addition, TypeScript is compatible with existing Javascript libraries and frameworks, making it easy to transition to using the language.

![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-E34F26?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white): is the fifth version of HTML (HyperText Markup Language), which is the standard language used to create web pages. With HTML5, it is possible to create more interactive pages, rich in multimedia content and compatible with different devices. Among the main improvements introduced by HTML5, we can highlight: Native support for audio and video, without the need for external plugins; New tags for structuring the content of pages, such as header, footer, nav, section, article, and others
Support for creating graphics and animations with the canvas tag; Support for creating more advanced forms, with new input types, such as email, url, number, range, date, and others; Improvements in accessibility support, such as adding new tags for describing elements and adding new attributes to improve navigation for users with disabilities. In short, HTML5 is an evolution of the HTML language that offers more features and possibilities for creating web pages, as well as facilitating compatibility with different devices.

## License for developers.
The MIT License (also known as the X11 License) is a permissive free software license, widely used for open source software. It was written by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1988 for its own software projects.

The MIT license allows the software to be used, copied, modified, distributed, including for commercial purposes, provided that the copyright notice and license are included on all copies and that the copyright notice and license are included on all derivative works.

The MIT license is considered a permissive license because it does not impose many restrictions on users of the software. For example, it does not require that the source code be made publicly available or that derived software be distributed under the same license. This flexibility is one reason why the MIT License is one of the most popular licenses among software developers.

However, it is important to note that the MIT License is a limited liability license. This means that developers are not liable for any damages caused by the software, which can be a concern in some cases.

In summary, the MIT License is a popular option for developers who wish to make their software free and open, allowing others to use and modify the source code without many restrictions.
